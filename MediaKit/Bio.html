          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  enjoyed some exciting adventures, white-water rafting through the Grand Canyon,  fly fishing &nbsp;the great rivers of the  West, hiking in Montana, Colorado, Wyoming and Arizona and kayaking across the  Gulf of Alaska,&rdquo; Holdren says, &ldquo;yet the Adirondacks retains its mystical hold  on me. Paddling a remote lake, or climbing in the High Peaks,  there&rsquo;s a magical connection between the beauty of wild, unspoiled places and a  power greater than our own.&rdquo; </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark W.  Holdren was born in Pittsburgh,   PA, in 1942. Raised in suburban Rochester, NY, he  graduated from Brighton High School in 1960 and Ithaca College  in 1965.&nbsp; After working as a newspaper  reporter, Holdren joined the marketing staff at Rochester&rsquo;s Genesee Brewing Company where he  worked for 32-years. He retired in 1999 as vice president-marketing services  and turned his full attention to creative writing. He resides on the banks of  the historic Erie Canal in Fairport,   NY.</p></td>
