                        “There is an innate connection between humans and the natural world,” Holdren says. “I’ve long felt a magical connection between the beauty of wild, unspoiled places and a power greater than our own. I hope that my writing awakens the reader’s spirit to a deepened awareness of nature and peaceful mindfulness with all of life.”
