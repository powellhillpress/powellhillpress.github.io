                        <br />
                        Henry David Thoreau believed “we can never have enough of nature.” There is an innate connection between humans and the natural world. It is a timeless bond that is now more essential to our health and well-being than ever before. Thoreau and Me in the Finger Lakes awakens the reader’s spirit to a deepened awareness of nature and peaceful mindfulness with all of life.
